NOT YET FINISHED.
NOT YET TESTED.

Turn a EPC611 ToF 8x8 image sensor into a 4000fps high speed greyscale camera.
Expected parts cost...like $25 probably.

Note: I'm currently (July 7, 2023) filling in the parts footprint/mfr/lcsc by what looks correct and highly available on JLCPCB.

Released MIT license.  Derived from the EPC611 spec sheet, not sure to what extent that affects this?
