NOT YET FINISHED.
Testing yielded mixed results.

Turn a EPC611 ToF 8x8 image sensor into a 4000fps high speed greyscale camera.
Expected parts cost...like $25 probably.

I did some testing on some JLCPCB boards - I did get some high speed results (I forget how fast) -
1. I had some difficulty getting the data off the board into the computer fast enough and accurately
2. The FOV was *very* small, which made it hard to test right, hard to tell what I was looking at, etc.
3. The picture seemed kinda...splotchy?  Like there were patches that were stained bright or dark or st, moreso toward the edges.

Released MIT license.  Derived from the EPC611 spec sheet, not sure to what extent that affects this?
